# Transfer Learning in Dog Breed Identification

## Abstract
This repository presents a comparative study on the effectiveness of transfer learning techniques in the classifying types of dog breed identification. The primary focus is on assessing the performance of models across two distinct datasets, both with and without the integration of a center loss function.

## Key Points:

### Datasets: <br>
The research employs two diverse datasets to evaluate the performance of transfer learning models i.e. Stanford dog breeds dataset and the Kaggle dog breed dataset.

### Center Loss Function: <br>
We analyse the impact of incorporating a center loss function on model accuracy.

### Data Augmentation: <br>
Our approach leverages data augmentation techniques to increase dataset size and improve model generalization.
